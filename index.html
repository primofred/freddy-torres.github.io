									<h2><a >My goal<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I am currently seeking an internship position, so I can use all the academic knowledge learned and translate it into real world experience.
										 I am desired to have the opportunity and get experienced in Mechanical, Structural, Electronic Circuits, and Design Analysis fields.
										 Academic courses gave me an exposure to these areas and I want to have the chance to show what I can do and that I can get things done.</p>

									<a href="https://owllife.kennesaw.edu/organization/auv" class="image fit"><img src="images/AUV SUB.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The organization has the goal of building and upgrading an autonomous underwater vehicle (submarine) for the AUV Competition. 
										The vehicle must complete several tasks with underwater obstacles. Mechanical, Electrical, and Software teams share and apply technical skills with the purpose of gaining design and hands-on experience. <br /><br />
										In my time at the AUV team, I have designed and 3Dprinted parts for upgrading areas of the submarine. Moreover, I have been researching for different ways to dissipate heat produced by Electronic Speed Control (ESC),
										which is a component that regulates the speed of the motor and produces an excesive amount of heat inside the submarine.
										 Using equations of Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, I have been understanding the behavior of the ESCs and analyzing solutions like fans, heat pipes, heat sinks, Peltier coolers, etc.<br /><br />
										The team is now in the process of restructuring the submarine. Metal sheets have been cut using a water jet cutter and new designs will come in soon.

									<p> As an Outreach Chair for SHPE at KSU, 
										I have stablished connections with different companies, so events where students and employers interact, learn from each other, and networking can be accomplished. <br /><br />
										I am working for benefits between companies and students. For students, a chance for future employment opportunities.
										On the other hand, for companies, more recognition from students on campus and awarness of job opennings.
										Also, another essential duty that I have as an Outreach Chair is
										to organize potential sponsorship opportunities for the organization.<br /><br />
										My desired impact in this organization is to encourage students that feel identify as Hispanics or Latinos to join SHPE, so we can all grow professionally and help each other to succeed in our careers.<br /><br />

									<a href="https://engineering.kennesaw.edu/clue-center/index.php" class="image fit"><img src="images/KSU PHOTO.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As a tutor at The CLUE Center, I have the privilage of helping students with different engineering, math, and science topics from different courses. 
										Every week I have either in-person or online sessions with individual or group of students.<br /><br />
									I enjoy helping people, and knowing that students who are struggling in class can suceed thanks to me, makes me feel happy. The most interesting part of tutoring is that I have to develope a quick strategy to help students understand a topic that maybe abstract or difficult to catch. <br /><br />
									The job allows me to excersice the knowledge that I have learned by teaching others; and it gives me a better preparation for the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam. </p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/GSU LOGO.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>	Several tasks were assigned to me when I was working for the admissions office at GSU Perimeter College.<br /><br />
										I gave campus tours and got the chance to improve my presentational skills. This helped me develope a way to catch the people's attention while I was explaining the campus' facilities.<br /><br />
										I provided information about the University, helped students apply to the school, received documents to store in the school’s data base, and solved the student’s issues regarding the application’s process which helped to develop intrapersonal skills</p>

										<h2><a >Electronic Speed Control (ESC) mount AUV team (Project)<br />

									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/ESC mount.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/ESC mount real.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> The Electronic Speed Control (ESC) components have the main function of regulating the speed of the motors that run the submarine. 
										One particular issue that the ESCs in the submarine had was that they where hanging with several wires and that produced involuntary damaged when the wires where arragend or other parts where replaced.
										Another problem of the ESCs is that they produce a great amount of heat. I wanted to find a way to solve the placement issue and improve the heat dissipation.<br /><br />
										Using SolidWorks, I designed a mount that could have the ESCs in a fixed posiiton. This way, Electrical Team members could easily replace and manage them.
										The mounts have an open area and holes that allow heat dissipation, and it has the capability of placing a small fan on top of the ESCs.  <br /><br />
										After the design was done and revised, a 3DPrinter was used to produce a physical model and it is now used in the submarine.

										<h2><a >Rocket-Powered Sled Function Code Using MATLAB (Project)<br />

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/MATLAB 1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/MATLAB 3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> For my MATLAB course, I was assigned to create a function that could solve a physics problem. I decided to create one about a rocket-powered sled which involved paramaters such as acceleration, distance, velocity, and time.
										The user can use the function to calculate any of the parameter desired based on the values given. It has the option of calculating and having the output as a scalar or vectors, and it is capable of ploting the values in graphs 
										generated by the software.<br /><br />
										Several coding techniques were used like "If, Else and Elseif Statements," "While Loops," "Display" function, graph plotting, etc. 
										The project allowed to use all the knowledge absorbed from the semester and showed me how powerful MATLAB can be as a tool for solving engineering problems form the real world.
